## Known Limitations (Document for Users)

1. **Static analysis only** - Cannot detect runtime secrets
2. **Pattern-based** - May miss custom token formats
3. **False positives** - Documentation examples may trigger
4. **GitHub API rate limits** - 5000 req/hour for remote scans
5. **No secret remediation** - Detection only, not automatic fixes

These are documented in README.md and OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md.
